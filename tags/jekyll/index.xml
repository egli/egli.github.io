      <description>I must say that I really enjoy working with Jekyll. It is dead-simple and still powerfull enough to the things I need. At first I was trying to go for a Clojure based solution such as static or madness. I had looked at static before and I like it, however I wanted to use bootstrap and wasn&amp;rsquo;t really into converting the bootstrap html to a hiccup template. madness on the other hand uses enlive, so it would have been possible to use html templates, but what I didn&amp;rsquo;t like was the fact that the generator and the actual site were basically the same code base just in different (git) branches.</description>
