      <description>There are some proponents of the Braille in DAISY Pipeline 2 project who would like to re-implement liblouis in Java. While I would much rather hack in Java than in C I still think it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to re-implement liblouis in Java.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first have a look at what liblouis is:
 Liblouis is a library and a set of tables that translates text into Braille. But first and foremost liblouis is a community of likeminded people from all over the world who work together to improve the state of Braille translation and formatting.</description>

      <title>Continuous integration for liblouis</title>

      <description>Once in a while when creating a pull request for projects on github I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised that this automatically launches a build server, runs the test suite for the project and hopefully gives you a green light for your pull request.
For liblouis we did have a self-hosted continuous integration solution based on Jenkins for a long time but it seems to have fallen prey to some bit rot.
So, ever since liblouis moved to github I wanted to set up Travis for continuous integration.</description>

      <title>A static website for liblouis based on Jekyll</title>

      <description>I must say that I really enjoy working with Jekyll. It is dead-simple and still powerfull enough to the things I need. At first I was trying to go for a Clojure based solution such as static or madness. I had looked at static before and I like it, however I wanted to use bootstrap and wasn&amp;rsquo;t really into converting the bootstrap html to a hiccup template. madness on the other hand uses enlive, so it would have been possible to use html templates, but what I didn&amp;rsquo;t like was the fact that the generator and the actual site were basically the same code base just in different (git) branches.</description>
